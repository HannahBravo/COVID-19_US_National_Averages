# COVID-19_US_National_Averages
This is part1 of my Capstone for the University of Colorado Boulder's Data Analysis with Tidyverse Certificate.

In this project, I ustilize the Tidyverse package in R to analyze the COVID-19 dataset imported from the New Your Times. 

I calculate and plot the total numner of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States from March 15, 2020 to December 31, 2022. I then calculate the number of new cases and deaths per day as well as a rolling 7-day average. With those calculations, I look at the days during the pandemic with the fewest number new cases & deaths, as well as the days with the largest number of new cases & deaths.  I also look at the difference between the average number of new cases & deaths and the median number of new cases & deaths, which was a difference of 30% - 40%.

Finally, I imported population estimate data to calculate the number of new cases & deaths as well as the rolling 7-day average per 100,000 people. With that I was able to plot a time series graph comparing the 7-day average of cases per 100,000 people to the 7-day average of deaths per 100,000 people. The time series showed some striking extremes as well as some expected trends. For instance, the 7-day average of both cases and deaths reached maximums during the winter months, each year of the pandemic, but minimums during the summer months.
